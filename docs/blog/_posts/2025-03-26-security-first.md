At IoTDB Enhanced, we take security seriously. Your time series data is valuable, and we've built enterprise-grade security into every layer of the platform. Here's how we protect your data.

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

### JWT with HttpOnly Cookies

We use JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication, but we don't stop there:

```javascript
// Token is stored in HttpOnly cookie
// Inaccessible to JavaScript XSS attacks
res.cookie('auth_token', token, {
  httpOnly: true,
  secure: true,      // HTTPS only
  sameSite: 'strict', // CSRF protection
  maxAge: 3600000    // 1 hour
});
```

**Benefits**:
- Tokens can't be stolen by XSS attacks
- Automatic CSRF protection
- Secure transmission over HTTPS

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Define who can do what:

```javascript
// User roles
{
  "admin": ["read", "write", "delete", "manage_users"],
  "analyst": ["read", "write"],
  "viewer": ["read"]
}
```

**Use cases**:
- Give analysts read/write access without delete permissions
- Restrict sensitive operations to admins only
- Create custom roles for your organization

## 🛡️ Input Validation & Sanitization

### SQL Injection Prevention

All database queries use parameterized statements via Prisma ORM:

```typescript
// ✅ Safe - Parameterized
await prisma.datapoint.findMany({
  where: { timeseriesId: userInputId }
});

// ❌ Unsafe - Direct interpolation
await prisma.$queryRaw(
  `SELECT * FROM datapoints WHERE id = '${userInput}'`
);
```

### XSS Prevention

All user input is sanitized before storage:

```typescript
import { sanitizer } from '@/lib/sanitizer';

const clean = sanitizer.sanitizeString(userInput);
```

## 🚦 Rate Limiting

Prevent abuse with Redis-backed rate limiting:

```javascript
// 100 requests per 15 minutes per IP
const rateLimit = {
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,  // 15 minutes
  max: 100,                    // 100 requests
  keyGenerator: (req) => req.ip
};
```

**Protected endpoints**:
- Authentication: 10 attempts per 15 minutes
- API key creation: 5 attempts per hour
- Data export: 20 requests per hour

## 📝 Comprehensive Audit Logging

Every sensitive operation is logged:

```typescript
logger.info('User action', {
  userId: user.id,
  action: 'delete_timeseries',
  resourceId: timeseriesId,
  timestamp: new Date(),
  ip: req.ip,
  userAgent: req.headers['user-agent']
});
```

**Logged events**:
- User login/logout
- Data creation/modification/deletion
- API key management
- Permission changes
- Failed authentication attempts

## 🔒 Data Encryption

### At Rest
- Database encrypted with AES-256
- Redis encrypted with AES-256
- Environment variables encrypted

### In Transit
- TLS 1.3 for all connections
- Certificate pinning
- HSTS headers

## 🤖 AI Feature Isolation

AI functions run in isolated processes with strict resource limits:

```bash
# AI process with resource limits
prlimit --cpu=10 --as=2g su ai-executor
```

**Security measures**:
- Admin-only access
- Resource limits (CPU, memory)
- Separate authentication
- Detailed audit logging

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Never commit secrets** - Use environment variables
2. **Validate all input** - Never trust user input
3. **Use parameterized queries** - Prevent SQL injection
4. **Implement proper error handling** - Don't leak information

### For Operators

1. **Keep dependencies updated** - `npm audit fix`
2. **Use strong passwords** - Minimum 12 characters
3. **Enable HTTPS** - Never expose APIs over HTTP
4. **Regular security audits** - Review access logs monthly

### For Users

1. **Use strong passwords** - Mix of letters, numbers, symbols
2. **Enable 2FA** - When available
3. **Report suspicious activity** - Contact security team
4. **Log out from shared devices** - Protect your session
