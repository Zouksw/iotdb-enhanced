Time series forecasting is a powerful tool for predicting future values based on historical data. In this tutorial, we'll walk through everything you need to know to get started with forecasting in IoTDB Enhanced.

## What is Time Series Forecasting?

Time series forecasting uses historical data to predict future values. It's used in countless applications:

- **Business**: Sales forecasting, demand planning
- **IoT**: Predictive maintenance, resource optimization
- **Finance**: Stock prices, market trends
- **Healthcare**: Patient monitoring, disease outbreak prediction

## Prerequisites

Before we begin, make sure you have:

1. IoTDB Enhanced installed and running
2. Some time series data to work with
3. Basic understanding of REST APIs

## Step 1: Insert Historical Data

First, let's insert some historical data points:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/timeseries/ts-123/data \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "datapoints": [
      {"timestamp": "2025-03-01T00:00:00Z", "value": 25.5},
      {"timestamp": "2025-03-01T01:00:00Z", "value": 26.0},
      {"timestamp": "2025-03-01T02:00:00Z", "value": 26.2}
    ]
  }'
```

## Step 2: Choose Your Algorithm

IoTDB Enhanced supports multiple forecasting algorithms:

### ARIMA
Best for: Seasonal data with trends
```json
{
  "algorithm": "arima",
  "horizon": 10
}
```

### Prophet
Best for: Business metrics with holidays
```json
{
  "algorithm": "prophet",
  "horizon": 24
}
```

### LSTM
Best for: Complex nonlinear patterns
```json
{
  "algorithm": "lstm",
  "horizon": 48
}
```

## Step 3: Generate a Forecast

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/ai/predict \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "timeseries": "device1_temperature",
    "horizon": 10,
    "algorithm": "arima",
    "confidenceInterval": 0.95
  }'
```

Response:
```json
{
  "forecastId": "fc-123",
  "predictions": [
    {
      "timestamp": "2025-03-28T10:00:00Z",
      "value": 26.5,
      "lower": 25.8,
      "upper": 27.2
    }
  ],
  "metrics": {
    "mape": 0.05,
    "rmse": 0.3
  }
}
```

## Step 4: Interpret the Results

The forecast returns:

- **value**: The predicted value
- **lower/upper**: 95% confidence interval
- **mape**: Mean Absolute Percentage Error (lower is better)
- **rmse**: Root Mean Square Error (lower is better)

## Step 5: Visualize Your Forecast

Use the web interface at `http://localhost:3000/forecasts` to:

- View your forecast as an interactive chart
- Compare predictions against actual values
- Download forecast data as CSV
- Share forecasts with your team

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Sufficient Historical Data
- Minimum: 50 data points
- Recommended: 500+ data points
- More data = better accuracy

### 2. Choose the Right Algorithm
- ARIMA for seasonal patterns
- Prophet for business metrics
- LSTM for complex patterns

### 3. Validate Your Model
- Split data into train/test sets
- Use metrics like MAPE and RMSE
- Compare multiple algorithms

### 4. Update Regularly
- Forecasts become less accurate over time
- Retrain models with new data
- Monitor prediction accuracy

## Advanced Features

### Custom Model Training

Train a model with custom parameters:

```bash
POST /api/ai/models/train
{
  "timeseries": "device1_temperature",
  "algorithm": "arima",
  "parameters": {
    "p": 1,
    "d": 1,
    "q": 1
  }
}
```

### Batch Forecasting

Forecast multiple time series at once:

```bash
POST /api/forecasts/batch
{
  "timeseries": ["ts-1", "ts-2", "ts-3"],
  "horizon": 10
}
```

## Troubleshooting

### Forecast is inaccurate
- Check if you have enough historical data
- Try a different algorithm
- Look for outliers in your data

### API returns error
- Verify your authentication token
- Check that the time series exists
- Ensure you have sufficient permissions

## Next Steps

Now that you understand the basics:

1. Explore the [API documentation](https://github.com/Zouksw/iotdb-enhanced/blob/main/docs/API.md)
2. Learn about [anomaly detection](https://github.com/Zouksw/iotdb-enhanced/blob/main/docs/blog/)
3. Set up [automated alerts](https://github.com/Zouksw/iotdb-enhanced/blob/main/docs/blog/)

Happy forecasting! 🚀
